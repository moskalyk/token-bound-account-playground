# token-bound-account-playground (or something simpler)
goal (axiom): design an applicable use case that uses erc6551 or something simpler, like that of an inventory system for a character.
goal (axiom): inspire constructable theorems at a level of computer science applied to fashion and avatar creation via how functional meets form

## approach assumptions
1. create simple js sdk implementation that wraps a sequence relayer 
2. sponsor contract & allow for gasless transactions, still with a signature
3. create interface to share user composition in a feed amongst an open network
4. allow for uploadable content and direct to mint in platform for extending a pallette of collectibles to curate from

## User Stories as Inference
As a user I want to scroll through feeds of assembled block-body representations, so that I can find a winning trend happening online

As a user I want to upload images and deploy to one of my collections so that I can share these tiled-blocks with people

## Inspiration
make it so that you're constructing fashionwear to be seen at a distance, full body, like across the street or in a field. constrained by tech and aimed to optimize the social trust dynamic for timely & fun trends for local towns

## possibilities for future
- AI regenerate & combine new assemblages into epochs
- AI generate port to cubist projects like minecraft or boomland
